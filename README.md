# ðŸŽ¨ Figma Plugins
A repository for functions that I need in figma, but are not yet available.

### Height Color Gradient
This plugin allows the user to set a specific gradient to be applied to a frame of rectangles (or frames) of varying heights, such that each rectangle will be set a solid color based on its height in relationship to the parent frame.
