### [Height Color Gradient](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1529549298440799386/height-color-gradient)
This plugin allows the user to set a specific gradient to be applied to a frame of rectangles (or frames) of varying heights, such that each rectangle will be set a solid color based on its height in relationship to the parent frame.

Available in the Figma community ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1529549298440799386/height-color-gradient)
